abstract: One of the first simulation-based introductory statistics curricula to be developed was the NSF-funded Change Agents for Teaching and Learning STatistics (CATALST) curriculum. True to its name, this curriculum is constantly undergoing change. This paper describes the story of the curriculum as it has evolved at the University of Minnesota and offers insight into promising new future avenues for the curriculum to continue to affect radical, substantive change in the teaching and learning of statistics. https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1787115
