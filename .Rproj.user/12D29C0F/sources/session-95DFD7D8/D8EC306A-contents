abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop the Basic Literacy In Statistics (BLIS) assessment for students in an introductory statistics course, at the postsecondary level, that includes, to some extent, simulation-based methods. The definition of statistical literacy used in the development of the assessment was the ability to read, understand, and communicate statistical information. Multiple instruments were available to assess students in introductory statistics courses; however, there were no assessments available that focused on statistical literacy. Evidence of reliability and validity were collected during the development of the assessment. Evidence of reliability and validity was high; however, more items with high difficulty levels could increase the precision in estimating ability estimates for higher achieving students.  https://iase-web.org/ojs/SERJ/article/view/164
